        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This style of scramble proves eye-opening for folks used to springy curds. This healthy scrambled eggs recipe proves just how creamy they can be. 
            These eggs taste so rich, you'll swear there's cheese in there somewhere.Constant vigilance is the price of perfection here. 
            Stir nonstop for small curds: The bigger the curds, the less creamy the texture. A slight sheen on the finished eggs means they're still wonderfully moist.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon unsalted butter</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                2 large eggs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
            </li>
    
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low. While butter melts, break eggs into a small bowl. 
                Use a fork to beat them like a red-feathered step-chicken until completely blended and slightly frothy. Stir in pepper and salt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Before the butter starts to froth, add the eggs; cook, stirring quickly and constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula or chopsticks. 
                Be patient; keep stirring. After a few minutes, steam will rise, the eggs will thicken, and small curds will begin to form. If you start to get 
                large curds no matter how quickly you stir, lift the pan from the burner to cool it down, stirring all the while. Cook, stirring constantly, until 
                the eggs hold together in a glistening, custard-soft, and loose mound that can still spread slightly, like risotto. Plate and eat immediately.</p>
