        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.<br>
        There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.<br>
        For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and  layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                15 ounces ricotta cheese</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste,  crushed tomatoes. 
                The three kinds of tomatoes gives the saucegreat depth of flavor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella,
                 and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. 
                Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
